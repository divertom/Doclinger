## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues.**

To report a security issue privately:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/divertom/docling-ui/security) of this repository.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability** (or **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**).
3. Submit the form. Your report is sent **privately** to the repository maintainers. It is not visible to the public until we publish an advisory.

GitHub does not have direct private messages between users; this “Report a vulnerability” flow is the way to contact maintainers privately. We will respond and work with you on the issue.

Thank you for helping keep Docling-UI safe.
